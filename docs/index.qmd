`dumbpy` is a small statistics-oriented package providing simple utilities for working with
nested iterables of numeric values.

## Quickstart

```python
from dumbpy import arithmetic_mean, std_deviation, median, flatten_list, validate_list

arithmetic_mean([1, 2, 3])
std_deviation([1, 2, 3])
median([1, 2, 3, 4])
flatten_list([[1, 2], [3]])
validate_list([1, 2, 3])
